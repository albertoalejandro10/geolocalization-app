# GeolocationApp

This is a geolocation app made with Angular v16.0.2 and Mapbox APIs. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge of Angular Framework.

I follow the rules and best practices from Angular to ensure my code is maintainable, scalable and easy to understand like:

- Consistent file stucture (Organize files and folders in a way to make it easy to find and understand).
- Single Responsibility Principle (Each component should have a single responsibility).
- TypeScript.
- Observables.

## Live DEMO

## Roadmap
In the future, I plan to add more functionality to the app, such as bike and walking routes. Additionally, I may also explore adapting the web interface for mobile devices to make it more accessible for users on the go.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
